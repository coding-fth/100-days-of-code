# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: November 14 2020
**Today's Progress**: 
- Completed the **Communicating using Markdown** course at [Github training](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/communicating-using-markdown) and found an additional training site here at [Microsoft training](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/learn/paths/collaborate-markdown-github-pages/)
- Forked the [100-days-of-code repo](https://github.com/crichID/100-days-of-code).

**Thoughts:** 
Having been stuck in limbo for a large period of time, this was a fantastic kickstarter to the process of learning code again.

- Practical
- Simple, sleek and very intelligent way to interact with github directly on the site and not get distracted by text editors, languages or code.

### Day 2: November 15 2020

**Today's Progress**:
- Accessed the repo for 100 days of code. Began to log the small steps I am making, very happy to make any small steps towards fully fledged programming.

**Thoughts** 
Would like to have some form of routeway towards further progress.

I *do* have a number of targets, and aim to chip away at them here.
I've been [Creating Blogs with Jekyll](https://www.apress.com/gb/book/9781484214657) and I have enrolled on this course[fast-secure-sites-blogs-with-jekyll](https://www.udemy.com/course/static-website-generator-fast-secure-sites-blogs-with-jekyll/learn/lecture/4223532#overview)
But am already beginning to feel overwhelmed again as I have a stack of Scratch,HTML,CSS,Javscript and Python resources I would like to clear through.
I know that this is only ever going to get done in chunks and have also begun progress on this javascript course which is fab []()

***Addendum*** training doesn't count? Oh no :/
Edited the rules, made me feel like less of a cheat, but still aim to continue progress.
The link in the rules has made me think, it is inspiring to think that a project may develop my skills more than blindly following tutorials[How to get a developer job in less than a year](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-get-a-developer-job-in-less-than-a-year-c27bbfe71645/) and I would like to have some practical work for the next 98 days, so will need to think further.
